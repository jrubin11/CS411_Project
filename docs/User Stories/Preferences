As a logged-in user, I want to be able to specify a wait time, price match, food preference via checkboxes. 
If the user does not have time to meal prep and wants to buy food outside during their busy schedule, then the user can use our app to find restaurants during the user's commutes. The user will be using google calendars to input his/her schedule as well as the location of each activity and that is how the user is authenticated. After the user logs in the web will show the user's schedule as a weekly calendar. At the top of the website,  there will be a maps/routes tab, a preferences tab, and a logout button. The user can pick their preferences from choices already in the app via checkboxes (when they want to eat, price range, type of food, and range for waiting time) which will be saved in a history folder of sorts if the user wishes them to be saved (which will be another checkbox at the bottom of the tab). The Web app will go through a Yelp API and find a restaurant that best matches the user preferences. 
If there are no matches then the app will pull up the closest convenience store where the user can pick up snacks.
