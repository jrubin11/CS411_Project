As a logged-in user, I want to confirm whether I have followed the application's recommendation, and send feedback to the web to build personal user preference and user history.
If the user visited the restaurant, the app will request how long they waited and to give the restaurant a rating. Also, if the user complains that the actual waiting time was too long. The website will record the information.  However, the user can always bypass giving feedback.
