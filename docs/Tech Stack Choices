Our team used Flask as our framework with Yelp Fusion API and Eventful API to create our app. We also used Google as our OAuth login.

We chose to use Flask because it is a python library and the majority of our group as used python. Flask is also a great framwork that makes it really easy to make a web applicaiton and test it. You can deploy locally and debug your code. It also has great documentation for all of its uses, as well as making it very easy to implement Google OAuth 2.0. We used SQLite as our database along side Flaks because they are very compatable and makes it really easy to create and add objects to table.

We decided to use Yelp Fusion as our first API becasue we are making a food app so we need an API that could search and return food data. Yelp is also a well known cmpany and was very trustworthy as well as having great documentation.

We decided to use Eventful as our second API because we needed another API that could the user find events near them that fit into our app. Eventful was great because it was very easy to use and implement and had good documentation for our use cases.
